# escape-the-horde

This is a Unity game development project utilizing C#.

Currently the player is able to move with WASD and then clicking with the mouse fires a bullet in that direction. There are enemies that spawn and can be killed, power ups, and a Randomizer that provides a random weapon enhancement (such as firing double bullets or piercing bullets).

On GitHub, I have only included the Scripts folder.
